# Javascript-UFO-challenge

The purpose of this challenge was to demonstrate the uses of Javascript for interactive websites, specifically using D3.js. This challenge collects HTML form elements, in the form of document object models. By completing this challenge, it uses a webpage for UFO sightings using HTML, javascript and CSS and using JavaScript and HTML, I mnodified the code in the index.html file to create more table filters and present a solution. In addition to the date filter created in this module, add filters for the city, state, country, and shape to describe further. This project focuses on building a dynamic webpage that accepts user inputs and adjusts accordingly to display information about UFO sightings.
In order to perform their analysis, users will be able to filter the UFO sightings table based on multiple criteria such as the event date, city, state, country and shape.
